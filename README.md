# ML_CoarseGrained_CRM_NWP
Machine learning of coarse-grained cloud-resolving numerical weather prediction model forecast data

Python code to train some deep neural networks to predict the evolution forward in time of the vertical profile of potential temperature and total humidity from some coarse-grained high-resolution numerical weather prediction (NWP) model data. We train on coarse-grained high-resolution data as it is likely to be more accurate than coarse-resolution model data.
